v0.4.0:

  * Fix compatibility with Django 1.10; thanks Gabriel Duman.

v0.3.4:

  * Fix cyclic import dependency in  Django 1.9; thanks Alexander Komkov.

v0.3.3:

  * Remove use of deprecated django.util.importlib; thanks David Costa.
  * Fix typo in documentation; thanks Shicha An


v0.3.2:

  * Only require watchdog to be available if we're actually using the
    autoreload functionality; thanks Andrew Pendleton.


v0.3.1:

  * Remove trailing slashes in MANIFEST.in, which break setuptools when
    used on Windows.


v0.3.0:

  * Remove support for application-supplied config files.  They seemed to be
    causing more problems than they solved, and none of the built-in ones
    provided more than a few lines of logic.
  * Remove the default "runserver" program, for the same reasons as above.
  * Add setting and option to specify the supervisord config file; that's
    SUPERVISOR_CONFIG_FILE and --config-file respectively.
  * Add "templated" template filter to apply templating to other config files;
    thanks Michael Rooney.
  * Make autoreload include/ignore patterns configurable via settings;
    thanks Hannes Struss.
  * Don't autoreload when .pyc or .pyo files change, only .py files.  This
    avoids spurious reloads when a .py file is compiled for the first time.


v0.2.8:

  * Ensure that the forked autoreload subprocess exits; thanks rassie.
  * Limit autoreload callback firing to once per second; thanks rassie.


v0.2.7:

  * Use watchdog for the auto-reload mechanism instead of continuously 
    polling the filesystem; thanks jezdez.


v0.2.6:

  * Fix `manage.py supervisor getconfig` to work with the changes introduced
    in version 0.2.5; thanks sebleier.


v0.2.5:

  * Fix `manage.py supervisor reload` to actually work, with the handy
    benefit of also reloading the config file from disk; thanks jezdez.


v0.2.4:

  * Support for Django-1.4-style project directory layout; thanks j4mie.
  * Add --project-dir option; thanks j4mie.


v0.2.3:

  * Add --pidfile and --logfile options; this is helpful when hooking the
    `manage.py supervisor` script into system init scripts.


v0.2.2:

  * Fix handling of "--" in options list.
  * Explicitly use {{ PYTHON }} {{ PROJECT_DIR }}/manage.py in all default
    recipes.  Using just {{ PROJECT_DIR }}/manage.py can be troublesome if
    the #! line in manage.py doesn't match the version of python you're
    using on the command-line.


v0.2.1:

  * Stop manage.py trying to parse options intended for supervisorctl.
  * Ensure the auto-generated username is less than 8 characters. (This
    works around an authentication bug in some versions of supervisord).
  * Many tweaks to the default configuration based on early user feedback.


v0.2.0:

  * More flexibility in selecting programs via command-line options.  You
    can now override both the "autostart" and "exclude" options:
      -l/--launch    =>  launch program automatically on startup
      -n/--nolaunch  =>  don't launch automatically, but keep in config
      -x/--exclude   =>  entirely remove program from the config
      -i/--include   =>  keep program from the config
  * Rename "autorestart" to "autoreload" since the former is an existing
    supervisord option that means something very different.  Also:
        * Allow selecting a subset of processes to auto-relod, via config file
          or command-line switch.
        * Add --noreload command-line switch to disable the autoreloader
  * Add a contrib supervisord.conf for django-ztask.
  * Add "getconfig" command, to print the final merged config to stdout.


v0.1.1:

  * In debug mode, provide an "autorestart" process that watches your code
    and restarts all processes when something changes.
  * project-specific config:  allow pre-specified [program] sections to be
    completely removed from the config, by specifying exclude=true.
  * project-specific config:  allow a [program:__overrides__] section to
    override options in all program sections at once.  Useful for things
    like globally switching autostart on/off or redirecting stderr.
  * app-specific config files:  use only one of management/supervisord.conf
    or contrib/<appname>/supervisord.conf, never both.  This prevent us
    from accidentally conflicting with settings specified by app authors.


v0.1.0:

  * Initial release; you might say *everything* has changed.
